# Agent Instructions

## Development Environment

This project uses a devcontainer with pixi for environment management.

### Available Tools

- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)**: Available via `pixi run gh` or directly if using a login shell. The container mounts the host's `~/.config/gh` directory, so if the user is authenticated on the host, authentication is shared automatically.

### Running Commands

When using pixi tasks, prefer `pixi run <task>`. See `pixi task list` for available tasks.

For tools installed as dependencies (like `gh`), you can run them via:
- `pixi run gh <args>` - works in any shell
- `gh <args>` - works in login shells (`bash -l -c '...'`)
